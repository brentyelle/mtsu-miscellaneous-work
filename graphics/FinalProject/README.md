**ASSIGNMENT:**     Project 4, Part III

**DUE DATE:**       12/12/2023

**DESCRIPTION:**    Inspired by a wacky version of chess played on the r/AnarchyChess subreddit (https://i.redd.it/js2zvlxfe9p71.jpg), this is a park with a giant chessboard and random toys & game pieces all over the place. There are several user input keys that can be pressed for functionality:
*   keyboard `A` causes the checkers to rotate nonsensically in place
*   keyboard `R` causes the scene to rotate slowly, and it also plays a sound clip saying "It's time to duel!" from the anime "Yu-Gi-Oh"
*   keyboard `B` causes the scene to reset to its original setup
*   LMB+drag rotates the scene about the origin
*   RMB+drag translates the scene in the direction dragged
*   scroll wheel zooms in/out

*   its-time-to-duel.mp3 -- ultimately from the show Yu-Gi-Oh
*   points used to define the LAMPPOST object -- derived by manually marking points on a picture taken from Google Images, then converting those points to vertices using MS Excel calculations (see `lamppost.png` and `lamppost.ods`)
